## üéØ Introduction

Codeforces is one of the most popular platforms for competitive programming, offering a plethora of challenges that test your algorithmic skills and problem-solving abilities. This repository serves as a resource for anyone looking to:

- Prepare for upcoming Codeforces contests.
- Practice and improve problem-solving skills.
- Learn new algorithms and data structures.

Each solution is crafted with care, providing clear and concise code along with explanations where necessary. Dive in to explore, learn, and become a better competitive programmer!

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder Structure

The repository is meticulously organized into folders, each representing a specific contest or problem set:

- **Contests**
  - **ContestName_ContestID**: Solutions to problems from specific Codeforces contests.
- **Problems by Difficulty**
  - **Div2_A**: Solutions to Div2 A problems.
  - **Div2_B**: Solutions to Div2 B problems.
  - **Div2_C**: Solutions to Div2 C problems.
  - **Div2_D**: Solutions to Div2 D problems.
  - **Div1**: Solutions to Div1 problems.

## üîç How to Navigate

### By Contest
Each contest folder contains problems solved in that particular contest, with filenames indicating the problem letter (e.g., `A.cpp`, `B.cpp`).

### By Difficulty
Problems are also categorized by their difficulty levels, helping you focus on specific types of challenges to master.

## üìö Problem Index

Check out the **[Problem Index](Problem_Index.md)** for a comprehensive list of all problems solved, along with links to the original problem statements and solutions.
